Base Node
=======================

The base node is the generic class for every node if you look at any node's superclass far enough.

It implements basic functionality that all nodes should have such as children, a run method, and the logic for overwriting parameters passed to the run method when run. 
Refer to :doc:`` for a more detailed explanation of how those parameters can be overwritten
